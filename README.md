# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I share my projects, code, and contributions to the tech community.

## About Me

- 👨‍💻 I'm currently working as an Electronics Engineering Student.
- 🌐 I have a strong interest in IoT Applications and Workflow Automation.
- 📚 I'm a continuous learner and love to explore new technologies.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Age of Information Analysis in Tandem Server System**
   
   Developed a simulation model in Simulink featuring a tandem system with 4 servers to evaluate the age of information of transmitted packets at each server and within the system.
   Translated the simulation into 
   MATLAB code to analyze server utilization patterns, calculate busy times, and determine the number of hops at different time intervals.
2. **Automated Office Entry System**
   
   Conceptualized, designed, and executed an advanced automated entry system for office spaces, prioritizing user convenience and hygiene.
3. **Book Cricket Game Simulator**
   
   Developed an interactive code-based solution that simulates the popular game of book cricket, allowing users to enjoy a digital version of the game.
