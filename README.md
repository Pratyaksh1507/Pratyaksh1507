Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I share projects, code, and contributions to the tech community.

**About Me**

👨‍💻 I am a recent B.Tech graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Srinagar.
🌐 My interests lie in IoT applications, workflow automation, and web development.
📚 Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in React through The Ultimate React Course 2024 on Udemy.

**Projects**

Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:

  Age of Information Analysis in Tandem Server System
  Developed a simulation model in Simulink featuring a tandem system with 4 servers to evaluate the age of information of transmitted packets. Used MATLAB to analyze server utilization, calculate busy times, and determine
  hop counts over time.

  Automated Office Entry System
  Conceptualized and built an automated IoT-based entry system for office spaces, focusing on user convenience and hygiene.

  Waste Derived TENG as Self-Powered Sensor   
  Designed a respiratory monitoring system using a Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) to convert exhaled air into electrical signals. Data was processed with Python and transmitted to Arduino for real-time visualization.
